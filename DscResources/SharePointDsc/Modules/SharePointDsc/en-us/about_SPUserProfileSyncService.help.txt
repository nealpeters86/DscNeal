.NAME
    SPUserProfileSyncService

# Description
    
    This resource is responsible for ensuring that the user profile sync service
    has been provisioned (Ensure = "Present") or is not running (Ensure =
    "Absent") on the current server. This resource uses the InstallAccount to
    validate the current state only, the set method which will do the provisioning
    uses the FarmAccount to do the actual work - this means that CredSSP
    authentication will need to be permitted to allow a connection to the local
    server. To allow successful provisioning the farm account must be in the local
    administrators group, however it is not best practice to leave this account in
    the Administrators group. Therefore this resource will add the FarmAccount
    credential to the local administrators group at the beginning of the set
