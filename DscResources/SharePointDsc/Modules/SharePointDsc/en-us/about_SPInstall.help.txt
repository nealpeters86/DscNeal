.NAME
    SPInstall

# Description
    
    This resource is used to install the SharePoint binaries. The BinaryDir
    parameter should point to the path that setup.exe is located (not to setup.exe
    itself). The ProductKey parameter is used to inject in to the configuration
    file and validate the license key during the installation process. This module
    depends on the prerequisites already being installed, which can be done

    The directory that contains all of the SharePoint binaries

.PARAMETER ProductKey

.EXAMPLE
    This module will install SharePoint to the default locations. The binaries for
    SharePoint in this scenario are stored at C:\SPInstall (so it will look to run

    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPInstall InstallBinaries
            {
                BinaryDir  = "C:\SPInstall"
                ProductKey = "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This module will install SharePoint to the specific locations set for the
    InstallPath and DataPath directories. 


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPInstall InstallBinaries
            {
                BinaryDir   = "D:\SharePoint\Binaries"
                InstallPath = "D:\SharePoint\Install"
                DataPath    = "D:\SharePoint\Data"
                ProductKey  = "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
            }
        }
    }

            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount

                Arguments          = "/config E:\SharePoint2013\files\setupfarmsilent\config.xml"
                ProductID          = "90150000-1014-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE"
