    SPServiceAppSecurity

# Description
    
    This resource is used to manage the sharing security settings of a specific
    service application. There are a number of approaches to how this can be
    implemented. Firstly you can set permissions for the app administrators, or
    for the sharing permission by specifying the SecurityType attribute. These
    options correlate to the buttons seen in the ribbon on the "manage service
    applications" page in Central Administration after you select a specific
    service app. The "Members" property will set a specific list of members for
    the service app, making sure that every user/group in the list is in the group
    and all others that are members and who are not in this list will be removed.
    The "MembersToInclude" and "MembersToExclude" properties will allow you to
    control a specific set of users to add or remove, without changing any other
    members that are in the group already that may not be specified here, allowing
