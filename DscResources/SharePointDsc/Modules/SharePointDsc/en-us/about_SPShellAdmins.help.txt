.NAME
    SPShellAdmins

# Description
    
    This resource is used to manage the users with Shell Admin permissions. There
    are a number of approaches to how this can be implemented. The "Members"
    property will set a specific list of members for the group, making sure that
    every user/group in the list is in the group and all others that are members
    and who are not in this list will be removed. The "MembersToInclude" and
    "MembersToExclude" properties will allow you to control a specific set of
    users to add or remove, without changing any other members that are in the
    group already that may not be specified here, allowing for some manual
    management outside of this configuration resource. The "ContentDatabases" and
    "AllContentDatabases" properties will allow you to control the permissions on
    Content Databases.
    
    Requirements:
    
    * At least one of the Members, MemberToInclude or MembersToExclude properties
      needs to  be specified.
    * Do not combine the Members property with the MemberToInclude and
      MembersToExclude  properties.
    * Do not combine the ContentDatabase property with the AllContentDatabases
      property.
    
    Notes:
    1.) If a content database is created using the Central Admin, the farm account
    is the owner of that content database in SQL Server. When this is true, you
    cannot add it to the Shell Admins (common for AllContentDatabases parameter)
    and the resource will throw an error. Workaround: Change database owner in SQL
