    SPUserProfileProperty

# Description
    
    This resource will create a property in a user profile service application. It
    creates, update or delete a property using the parameters that are passed in to
    it.
    
    The parameter DisplayOrder is absolute. ie.: If you want it to be placed as the
    5th field of section Bla, which has propertyName value of 5000 then your
    DisplayOrder needs to be 5005. If no DisplayOrder is added then SharePoint
    adds it as the last property of section X.
