.NAME
    SPCreateFarm

# Description
    
    This resource is used to provision a new SharePoint farm. It should only be
    used on the first server in the farm to create the configuration database, all
    servers to join the farm after the first server creates the configuration
    database should use SPJoinFarm. Once the config DB has been created, the
    resource will install local help collections, secure resources, activate
    features and provision the central admin site.
    
    The passphrase is passed as a Credential object.The username of this
    credential is ignored, only the value of the password is used as the farm
    passphrase.
    
    The port of the Central Admin website can be set by using the
    CentralAdministrationPort property, if this is not defined the site will be
    provisioned on port 9999. However this setting will not impact existing
    deployments that already have Central Admin provisioned on another port. Also
    when a farm is created, the current behavior is to not enroll the server as a
    cache server (which is the default behavior of SharePoint). This means you
    need to use SPDistributedCacheService on at least one server in the farm to
    designate it as a cache server.
    
    CentralAdministrationAuth can be specified as "NTLM" or "KERBEROS". If not
    specified, it defaults to NTLM. If using Kerberos, make sure to have
    appropriate SPNs setup for Farm account and Central Administration URI.

    Required - String
    The account to use as the main farm account

.PARAMETER Passphrase
    Required - String
    The passphrase to use to allow servers to join this farm

.PARAMETER AdminContentDatabaseName
    Required - String
    The name of the admin content database

.PARAMETER CentralAdministrationPort
    Write - uint32
    What port will Central Admin be provisioned to - default is 9999

.PARAMETER CentralAdministrationAuth
    Write - String
    Allowed values: NTLM, Kerberos
    The authentication provider of the CentralAdministration web application

.PARAMETER ServerRole
    Write - string
    Allowed values: Application, ApplicationWithSearch, Custom, DistributedCache, Search, SingleServer, SingleServerFarm, WebFrontEnd, WebFrontEndWithDistributedCache

.PARAMETER InstallAccount
    Write - String
    POWERSHELL 4 ONLY: The account to run this resource as, use PsDscRunAsCredential if using PowerShell 5


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how a basic SharePoint farm can be created. The database server and names
    are specified, and the accounts to run the setup as, the farm account and the passphrase are
    all passed in to the configuration to be applied. By default the central admin site in this
    example is provisioned to port 9999 using NTLM authentication.

    all passed in to the configuration to be applied. By default the central admin site in this
    example is provisioned to port 9999 using NTLM authentication. In this example we also see
    the server role defined as "Application" which tells SharePoint 2016 the role to apply to
    this server as soon as the farm is created. This property is not supported for SharePoint 2013
    and so this specific example would fail if used against that verison.
